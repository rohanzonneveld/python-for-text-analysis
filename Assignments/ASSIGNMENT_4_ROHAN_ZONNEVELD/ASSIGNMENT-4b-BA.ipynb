    "* VADER provides 4 scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound). Be sure to understand what they mean and how they are calculated.\n",
    "* VADER uses rules to handle linguistic phenomena such as negation and intensification. Be sure to understand which rules are used, how they work, and why they are important.\n",
    "* VADER makes use of a sentiment lexicon. Have a look at [the lexicon](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt). Be sure to understand which information can be found there (lemma?, wordform?, part-of-speech?, polarity value?, word meaning?) What do all scores mean? You can inspect [the README](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) of the VADER system for more information.\n",

    "Consider the following sentences and their output as given by VADER. Analyze sentences 1 to 7, and explain the outcome **for each sentence**. Take into account both the rules applied by VADER and the lexicon that is used. You will find that some of the results are reasonable, but others are not.
